											Node.js Fundamentals

What is Node.js?
 Node.js is platform(runtime and set of apis and tools), to run js code.
 Node.js is JavaScript runtime.

Runtime:
 To execute compiled intermediate code into machine code

How js code is compiled and executed?

Hello.java (source code)--->javac(compiler)---->Hello.class(bytecode)---->java---Executed on JRE

Program:
  1.source code 
     Hello.java
  2.compiled code
     Hello.class

Flow:
   source-compiled code- execute the code
   source code - compiler--- compiled code --->Runtime

Does js code is compiled or not?

yes

Types of js runtime.

1.browser js 
2.desktop js -node.js
3.others - Mobile

		js runtime works based on ECMA Spec(js lang spec)

Why js was created?
  For building dynamic web apps at client side -DOM programming

Why Node.js?
           Node .js created to build "non blocking io applications" on JavaScript

What is io?
What is blocking ?
What is non blocking ?

File Descriptor:

Program - api - high level 
 |       
 Runtime
os ------api ---low level -system call
  ------ User space
 | -----Kernal space - File descriptor (Program which is responsible for io)
    
hardware


File descriptor:
 It is program, written c language - c program
 C program has an array

Non blocking apis in Linux:

1.select + read
2.poll
3.epoll - event driven architecture

Nginx was the first non blocking web server.

In 2007,Ryan Dahl, who developed an architecture called "Node.js" based on js language.

google released js runtime called v8 as open source, based on v8, node.js was created

Libuv offers

1.OS abstraction apis
2.Threads
  Libuv has two types of threads
 1.Event loop thread - non blocking io thread
    It has only one event loop thread
    ->handles network io operations - webservers, tcp servers, datagram servers
 2.Worker pool thread - blocking io and tasks
    ->handles file io operations both non blocking and blocking
